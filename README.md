# User Management System

This project is a **User Management System** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**. It allows for efficient user registration, authentication, and management, providing essential functionality such as user creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD operations). The project is structured to follow the best practices of code organization and is easily scalable.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can sign up with their details.
- **User Authentication**: Login functionality with password hashing and token-based authentication (JWT).
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted through RESTful API routes.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for authentication, error handling, and validation.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety throughout the application.
- **Database Integration**: The system connects to a MongoDB database to store user information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sourabhsahu33/User_Management_System_backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```
cd user-management-system
```

3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory with the following values-
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

5. Compile TypeScript-
```
npm run build
```

7. Start the development server-
```
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

Users

POST /api/users/register - Register a new user.
POST /api/users/login - Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.
GET /api/users/:id - Get a user by ID.
PUT /api/users/:id - Update user information.
DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete a user.

## Technologies Used

Node.js: Backend runtime.
Express: Web framework for building APIs.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript providing type safety.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB to interact with the database.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and authorization.
Bcrypt: Password hashing for security.

## Scripts

npm run build: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.
npm run dev: Runs the development server with TypeScript support.
npm start: Starts the compiled Node.js server.
